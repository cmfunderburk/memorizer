# Planning-Only Mode for Complex Features

## Critical Rule: No Implementation During Planning Phase

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: When working on any complex feature planning, DO NOT make any code changes until explicitly told by the user to start implementation.

## Planning Phase Requirements

During planning discussions:
1. **Focus on conceptual clarity**
2. **Design before coding** - Create comprehensive plans before any implementation
3. **Document decisions** - Write down design choices and rationale
4. **Validate approach** - Confirm understanding with user before proceeding

## Implementation Phase

Only begin implementation when the user explicitly states:
- "Start implementing"
- "Begin coding"
- "Make the changes"
- Or similar clear implementation directives

## Why This Matters

There are costs to implementing the wrong solution, e.g.:
- Building global systems instead of a problem-specific solutions
- May waste significant development time on technically correct but functionally wrong approaches
- May require complete reimplementation after requirements were clarified

## Enforcement

When in planning mode:
- ❌ DO NOT: Write to existing code files.
- ✅ DO use: read_file, grep, codebase_search, list_dir, web_search
- ✅ DO: Create planning documents, discuss architecture, clarify requirements. Planning documents always go in docs/planning/
- ✅ DO: Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions
